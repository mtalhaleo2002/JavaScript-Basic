// A prompt box asks the user for some information and provides a response field for her answer.

var spec = prompt("Your species?", "human");

console.log(spec); //It runs when you attch html file .

// Prompt code is like alert code, with two differences. In a prompt, you need a way to capture the user's response. That means you need to start by declaring a variable, followed by an equal sign.
// In a prompt, you can specify a second string. This is the default response that appears in the field when the prompt displays. If the user leaves the default response as-is and just clicks OK, the default response is assigned to the variable. It's up to you whether you include a default response
